# ⚽ Scout-Agent AI: Advanced Football Recruitment Intelligence

**Scout-Agent AI** is a professional-grade technical scouting platform designed for the 2026 Winter Transfer Window. By integrating **Generative AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash)** with **Advanced Data Science**, it transforms raw FBref performance data from the 2024-2025 season into actionable recruitment dossiers.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### 1. AI-Driven Performance Audits
The platform doesn't just show numbers; it interprets them. The AI Agent analyzes:
* **Efficiency Delta:** Comparing actual goals and assists against xG and xAG to identify clinical finishers vs. lucky streaks.
* **Tactical Sustainability:** Evaluating if a player's physical workload (minutes/starts) is sustainable for a top-tier club.

### 2. Tactical Similarity Engine (Statistical Twin Finder)
Leveraging **Cosine Similarity** algorithms, the dashboard calculates a "Tactical Match Score." 
* **Use Case:** If your primary target is unavailable, the engine identifies players with the most similar statistical "fingerprint" across progressive passing, carries, and defensive volume.

### 3. Multidimensional Radar Profiles
Interactive visualizations that normalize player performance against league maximums. 
* **Metrics:** xG, xAG, Progressive Carries, Progressive Passes, and Defensive Actions (Tkl+Int).

## 🔍 Discovery Interface
The sidebar allows for deep-dive scouting using three main vectors:
1.  **League Filter:** Focus on specific tactical environments (e.g., the physicality of the Premier League).
2.  **Position Filter:** Narrow down to `FW`, `MF`, `DF`, or `GK`.
3.  **Age/Availability Slider:** Filter by player age and total minutes played to ensure target reliability.

## ⚖️ Disclaimer & Usage
This tool is built for recruitment analysts and technical directors. The "Verdict" generated by the AI is based on 2024-2025 performance data and should be used as a secondary confirmation tool alongside traditional video scouting.
